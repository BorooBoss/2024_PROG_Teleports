# Console Game Teleports
The board game Teleports is played on a two-dimensional array with dimensions n-times-n (in the pictures we use 5-times-5 dimensions) 
Each player has 1 pawn. The object of the game is to get the piece out of the the starting space, which is located in the first row of the playing field on the left, to the finish field,
which is located in the last row of the board (if the board has an odd number of lines, it is box in the last column, if the area has an even number of rows, is in the first column). Every game has some amount of randomly generated positive
and negative teleports. More on how the generation works and what are some other rules can be found in `PROG1_projekt2024-1.pdf`

## General 
For representing multiple players I decided to use Object-oriented programming. The whole game works automatically and it is able to cope with all situations that may happen. Not sure what else to say, I guess
the best thing you can do is try the game yourself.
